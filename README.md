- fitting of 2 parallel parabolas: not the official text-book definition, but here 2 parallel parabolas p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub> are defined by: ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c<sub>0</sub> (p<sub>0</sub>); ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c<sub>1</sub> (p<sub>1</sub>). Then the parallel parabola fitting can be formulated by the following least squares problem:

## :tada: TODO
***

- [x] fitting of two parallel lines, demo code
- [x] fitting of two parallel parabola, demo code
- [x] add julia code (just to practice julia)

## üéõ  Dependencies
***

- python

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- julia

```bash
pkg> activate .
pkg> instantiate
```

## :running: How to Run ##
***

- python

    + demo for fitting of two parallel lines

    ```bash
    python demo_parallel_line_fitting.py
    ```

    + demo for fitting of two parabolas

    ```bash
    python demo_parallel_parabola_fitting.py
    ```

- julia

    + demo for fitting of two parallel lines

    ```bash
    julia --project=. demo_parallel_line_fitting.jl
    ```

    + demo for fitting of two parallel parabolas

    ```bash
    julia --project=. demo_parallel_parabola_fitting.jl
    ```

**You can also call the demo scripts from julia REPL with include syntax. This will reduce the latency for code loading and compilation for the second run on REPL. However, you will always suffer from loading and compilation latency if running directly from command line.**
